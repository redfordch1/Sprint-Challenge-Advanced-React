You have more control over everything. Hooks are just faster and easier.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes. 

componentDidMount- After all the elements of the page is rendered correctly, this method is called. After the markup is set on the page, this method is called to either fetch the data from An External API or perform some unique operation.

shouldComponentUpdate- Controls re-rendering.

componentWillUpdate- This method is invoked right before rendering. Like shouldComponentUpdate, it is called whenever new props are passed to the component, or the state is changed.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

They are reusable, and they make your code cleaner. 

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

Because its really frustrating to the user when something doesnt work right.
